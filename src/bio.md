    <p>
      I’m a Full Stack Web Developer with over a decade of experience in
      the industry. I have worked as a freelancer, in NGOs, at great creative companies, 
      ran my own web studio in Iceland (<a href="/work/brisa">Brisa</a>) during 4 years, taught and modeled the web development course at <a href="/education/vefskoli">Vefskóli</a> for over 3 years, and 
      I have co-founded a tourism startup in Vietnam (<a href="/work/conbeo">Conbeo</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      My most recent work experience was to help
      <a href="/work/icelandair">Icelandair</a>
      create better publishing tools and kick-start a new website from scratch,
      while being the lead front-end developer in the web team.

      <p>
        Admitedly, I’m the worse at drawing. To counter this small
        issue, I love creating pictures that don’t require this skill,
        like creating patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been experimenting with pencil, pen, watercolor and
        digital creation.

      <p>
        The questions with answers can amaze, but the ones without any
        make you stare into the void and wonder: why? 🔮
