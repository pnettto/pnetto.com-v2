backstorySection:
  text: >
    <p>This is a very dear project to me as it was part of the wonderful Biophilia Project, by the Icelandic singer Björk. The Icelandic Ministry of Education collaborated with her to create science teaching material based on the album and the result was brought to many schools across all Nordic countries.</p>
    <p>My job was to create an institutional website that could be used mainly by teachers but also by other people interested in the project. I led the organizational planning of content and collaborated with a designer to create the website that is now available.</p>
