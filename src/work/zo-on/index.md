backstorySection:
  text: >
    <p>ZO·ON is an Icelandic outdoor clothing brand which was looking to increase their online sales participation. I first advised on improvements on the design we had at hand bringing in my own designer for that task and making sure the mobile experience was as good as possible, a very important aspect of e-commerce.</p>
    <p>Then we devised a comfortable way their staff could update the website while leveraging a powerful sales platform. The result was a hybrid between Wordpress and Shopify: Wordpress was resourceful enough to allow managing different kinds of content while Shopify gave them all the tools they needed to manage their online store.</p>
    <p>I connected these systems making use of the Shopify Storefront API and their GraphQL interface, essentially transforming Shopify’s platform into a headless e-commerce system.</p>
    <p>Main technologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wordpress</li>
      <li>Shopify + Storefront API</li>
      <li>GraphQL</li>
    </ul>
