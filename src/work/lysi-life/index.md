backstorySection:
  text: >
    <p>Lýsi is the largest producer of fish oils in Iceland and they used to only sell their products to retailers. When CoPlus connected us they needed a multinational online platform to also sell their new premium product line directly to customers.</p>
    <p>While collaborating with the marketing, design and sales teams across different countries, I created a WooCommerce solution with multilanguage support and subscription payments capabilities, then went ahead to train their staff to operate the platform in Iceland and Sweden. </p>
    <p>Main technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wordpress + WooCommerce</li>
    </ul>
