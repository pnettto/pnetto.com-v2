Pedro worked at Icelandair‘s web team as our lead front-end developer and I highly recommend him to any similar role. His thoughtful observation and commitment to sharing knowledge through well-organized documentation significantly contributed to our team's success. With solid technical skills and effective communication, he would be a valuable addition to any web development project or team.
